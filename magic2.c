int main(){printf("harry potter and the deathly hallows by j k rowling chapter one the dark lord ascending the two men appeared out of nowhere a few yards apart in the narrow moonlit lane for a second they stood quite still wands directed at each other s chests then recognizing each other they stowed their wands beneath their cloaks and started walking briskly in the same direction news asked the taller of the two the best replied severus snape the lane was bordered on the left by wild low growing brambles on the right by a high neatly manicured hedge the men s long cloaks flapped around their ankles as they marched thought i might be late said yaxley his blunt features sliding in and out of sight as the branches of overhanging trees broke the moonlight it was a little trickier than i expected but i hope he will be satisfied you sound confident that your reception will be good snape nodded but did not elaborate they turned right into a wide driveway that led off the lane the high hedge curved into them running off into the distance beyond the pair of imposing wrought iron gates barring the men s way neither of them broke step in silence both raised their left arms in a kind of salute and passed straight through as though the dark metal was smoke the yew hedges muffled the sound of the men s footsteps there was a rustle somewhere to their right yaxley drew his wand again pointing it over his companion s head but the source of the noise proved to be nothing more than a pure white peacock strutting majestically along the top of the hedge he always did himself well lucius peacocks yaxley thrust his wand back under his cloak with a snort a handsome manor house grew out of the darkness at the end of the straight drive lights glinting in the diamond paned downstairs windows somewhere in the dark garden beyond the hedge a fountain was playing gravel crackled beneath their feet as snape and yaxley sped toward the front door which swung inward at their approach though nobody had visibly opened it the hallway was large dimly lit and sumptuously decorated with a magnificent carpet covering most of the stone floor the eyes of the pale faced portraits on the wall followed snape and yaxley as they strode past the two men halted at a heavy wooden door leading into the next room hesitated for the space of a heartbeat then snape turned the bronze handle the drawing room was full of silent people sitting at a long and ornate table the room s usual furniture had been pushed carelessly up against the walls illumination came from a roaring fire beneath a handsome marble mantelpiece surmounted by a gilded mirror snape and yaxley lingered for a moment on the threshold as their eyes grew accustomed to the lack of light they were drawn upward to the strangest feature of the scene an apparently unconscious human figure hanging upside down over the table revolving slowly as if suspended by an invisible rope and reflected in the mirror and in the bare polished surface of the table below none of the people seated underneath this singular sight were looking at it except for a pale young man sitting almost directly below it he seemed unable to prevent himself from glancing upward every minute or so yaxley snape said a high clear voice from the head of the table you are very nearly late the speaker was seated directly in front of the fireplace so that it was difficult at first for the new arrivals to make out more than his silhouette as they drew nearer however his face shone through the gloom hairless snakelike with slits for nostrils and gleaming red eyes whose pupils were vertical he was so pale that he seemed to emit a pearly glow severus here said voldemort indicating the seat on his immediate right yaxley c beside dolohov the two men took their allotted places most of the eyes around the table followed snape and it was to him that voldemort spoke first so my lord the order of the phoenix intends to move harry potter from his current place of safety on saturday next at nightfall the interest around the table sharpened palpably some stiffened others fidgeted all gazing at snape and voldemort saturday at nightfall repeated voldemort his red eyes fastened upon snape s black ones with such intensity that some of the watchers looked away apparently fearful that they themselves would be scorched by the ferocity of the gaze snape however looked calmly back into voldemort s face and after a moment or two voldemort s lipless mouth curved into something like a smile good very good and this information comes c c from the source we discussed said snape my lord yaxley had leaned forward to look down the long table at voldemort and snape all faces turned to him my lord i have heard differently yaxley waited but voldemort did not speak so he went on dawlish the auror let slip that potter will not be moved until the thirtieth the night before the boy turns seventeen snape was smiling my source told me that there are plans to lay a false trail this must be it no doubt a confundus charm has been placed upon dawlish it would not be the first time he is known to be susceptible i assure you my lord dawlish seemed quite certain said yaxley if he has been confunded naturally he is certain said snape i assure you yaxley the auror office will play no further part in the protection of harry potter the order believes that we have infiltrated the ministry the order s got one thing right then eh said a squat man sitting a short distance from yaxley he gave a wheezy giggle that was echoed here and there along the table voldemort did not laugh his gaze had wandered upward to the body revolving slowly overhead and he seemed to be lost in thought my lord yaxley went on dawlish believes an entire party of aurors will be used to transfer the boy c voldemort held up a large white hand and yaxley subsided at once watching resentfully as voldemort turned back to snape where are they going to hide the boy next at the home of one of the order said snape the place according to the source has been given every protection that the order and ministry together could provide i think that there is little chance of taking him once he is there my lord unless of course the ministry has fallen before next saturday which might give us the opportunity to discover and undo enough of the enchantments to break through the rest well yaxley voldemort called down the table the firelight glinting strangely in his red eyes will the ministry have fallen by next saturday once again all heads turned yaxley squared his shoulders my lord i have good news on that score i have c with difficulty and after great effort c succeeded in placing an imperius curse upon pius thicknesse many of those sitting around yaxley looked impressed his neighbor dolohov a man with a long twisted face clapped him on the back it is a start said voldemort but thicknesse is only one man scrimgeour must be surrounded by our people before i act one failed attempt on the minister s life will set me back a long way yes c my lord that is true c but you know as head of the department of magical law enforcement thicknesse has regular contact not only with the minister himself but also with the heads of all the other ministry departments it will i think be easy now that we have such a high ranking official under our control to subjugate the others and then they can all work together to bring scrimgeour down as long as our friend thicknesse is not discovered before he has converted the rest said voldemort at any rate it remains unlikely that the ministry will be mine before next saturday if we cannot touch the boy at his destination then it must be done while he travels we are at an advantage there my lord said yaxley who seemed determined to receive some portion of approval we now have several people planted within the department of magical transport if potter apparates or uses the floo network we shall know immediately he will not do either said snape the order is eschewing any form of transport that is controlled or regulated by the ministry they mistrust everything to do with the place all the better said voldemort he will have to move in the open easier to take by far again voldemort looked up at the slowly revolving body as he went on i shall attend to the boy in person there have been too many mistakes where harry potter is concerned some of them have been my own that potter lives is due more to my errors than to his triumphs the company around the table watched voldemort apprehensively each of them by his or her expression afraid that they might be blamed for harry potter s continued existence voldemort however seemed to be speaking more to himself than to any of them still addressing the unconscious body above him i have been careless and so have been thwarted by luck and chance those wreckers of all but the best laid plans but i know better now i understand those things that i did not understand before i must be the one to kill harry potter and i shall be at these words seemingly in response to them a sudden wail sounded a terrible drawn out cry of misery and pain many of those at the table looked downward startled for the sound had seemed to issue from below their feet wormtail said voldemort with no change in his quiet thoughtful tone and without removing his eyes from the revolving body above have i not spoken to you about keeping our prisoner quiet yes m my lord gasped a small man halfway down the table who had been sitting so low in his chair that it appeared at first glance to be unoccupied now he scrambled from his seat and scurried from the room leaving nothing behind him but a curious gleam of silver as i was saying continued voldemort looking again at the tense faces of his followers i understand better now i shall need for instance to borrow a wand from one of you before i go to kill potter the faces around him displayed nothing but shock he might have announced that he wanted to borrow one of their arms no volunteers said voldemort let s see lucius i see no reason for you to have a wand anymore lucius malfoy looked up his skin appeared yellowish and waxy in the firelight and his eyes were sunken and shadowed when he spoke his voice was hoarse my lord your wand lucius i require your wand i malfoy glanced sideways at his wife she was staring straight ahead quite as pale as he was her long blonde hair hanging down her back but beneath the table her slim fingers closed briefly on his wrist at her touch malfoy put his hand into his robes withdrew a wand and passed it along to voldemort who held it up in front of his red eyes examining it closely what is it elm my lord whispered malfoy and the core dragon c dragon heartstring good said voldemort he drew out his wand and compared the lengths lucius malfoy made an involuntary movement for a fraction of a second it seemed he expected to receive voldemort s wand in exchange for his own the gesture was not missed by voldemort whose eyes widened maliciously give you my wand lucius my wand some of the throng sniggered i have given you your liberty lucius is that not enough for you but i have noticed that you and your family seem less than happy of late what is it about my presence in your home that displaces you lucius nothing c nothing my lord such lies lucius the soft voice seemed to hiss on even after the cruel mouth had stopped moving one or two of the wizards barely repressed a shudder as the hissing grew louder something heavy could be heard sliding across the floor beneath the table the huge snake emerged to climb slowly up voldemort s chair it rose seemingly endlessly and came to rest across voldemort s shoulders its neck the thickness of a man s thigh its eyes with their vertical slits for pupils unblinking voldemort stroked the creature absently with long thin fingers still looking at lucius malfoy why do the malfoys look so unhappy with their lot is my return my rise to power not the very thing they professed to desire for so many years of course my lord said lucius malfoy his hand shook as he wiped sweat from his upper lip we did desire it c we do to malfoy s left his wife made an odd stiff nod her eyes averted from voldemort and the snake to his right his son draco who had been gazing up at the inert body overhead glanced quickly at voldemort and away again terrified to make eye contact my lord said a dark woman halfway down the table her voice constricted with emotion it is an honor to have you here in our family s house there can be no higher pleasure she sat beside her sister as unlike her in looks with her dark hair and heavily lidded eyes as she was in bearing and demeanor where narcissa sat rigid and impassive bellatrix leaned toward voldemort for mere words could not demonstrate her longing for closeness no higher pleasure repeated voldemort his head tilted a little to one side as he considered bellatrix that means a great deal bellatrix from you her face flooded with color her eyes welled with tears of delight my lord knows i speak nothing but the truth no higher pleasure even compared with the happy event that i hear has taken place in your family this week she stared at him her lips parted evidently confused i don t know what you mean my lord i m talking about your niece bellatrix and yours lucius and narcissa she has just married the werewolf remus lupin you must be so proud there was an eruption of jeering laughter from around the table many leaned forward to exchange gleeful looks a few thumped the table with their fists the giant snake disliking the disturbance opened its mouth wide and hissed angrily but the death eaters did not hear it so jubilant were they at bellatrix and the malfoys humiliation bellatrix s face so recently flushed wit happiness had turned an ugly blotchy red she is no niece of ours my lord she cried over the outpouring of mirth we c narcissa and i c have never set eyes on our sister since she married the mudblood this brat has nothing to do with either of us nor any beast she marries what say you draco asked voldemort and though his voice was quiet it carried clearly through the catcalls and jeers will you babysit the cubs the hilarity mounted draco malfoy looked in terror at his father who was staring down into his own lap then caught his mother s eye she shook her head almost imperceptibly then resumed her own deadpan stare at the opposite wall enough said voldemort stroking the angry snake enough and the laughter died at once many of our oldest family trees become a little diseased over time he said as bellatrix gazed at him breathless and imploring you must prune yours must you not to keep it healthy cut away those parts that threaten the health of the rest yes my lord whispered bellatrix and her eyes swam with tears of gratitude again at the first chance you shall have it said voldemort and in your family so in the world we shall cut away the canker that infects us until only those of the true blood remain voldemort raised lucius malfoy s wand pointed it directly at the slowly revolving figure suspended over the table and gave it a tiny flick the figure came to life with a groan and began to struggle against invisible bonds do you recognize our guest severus asked voldemort snape raised his eyes to the upside down face all of the death eaters were looking up at the captive now as though they had been given permission to show curiosity as she revolved to face the firelight the woman said in a cracked and terrified voice severus help me ah yes said snape as the prisoner turned slowly away again and you draco asked voldemort stroking the snake s snout with his wand free hand draco shook his head jerkily now that the woman had woken he seemed unable to look at her anymore but you would not have taken her classes said voldemort for those of you who do not know we are joined here tonight by charity burbage who until recently taught at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry there were small noises of comprehension around the table a broad hunched woman with pointed teeth cackled yes professor burbage taught the children of witches and wizards all about muggles how they are not so different from us one of the death eaters spat on the floor charity burbage revolved to face snape again severus please please silence said voldemort with another twitch of malfoy s wand and charity fell silent as if gagged not content with corrupting and polluting the minds of wizarding children last week professor burbage wrote an impassioned defense of mudbloods in the daily prophet wizards she says must accept these thieves of their knowledge and magic the dwindling of the purebloods is says professor burbage a most desirable circumstance she would have us all mate with muggles or no doubt werewolves nobody laughed this time there was no mistaking the anger and contempt in voldemort s voice for the third time charity burbage revolved to face snape tears were pouring from her eyes into her hair snape looked back at her quite impassive as she turned slowly away from him again avada kedavra the flash of green light illuminated every corner of the room charity fell with a resounding crash onto the table below which trembled and creaked several of the death eaters leapt back in their chairs draco fell out of his onto the floor dinner nagini said voldemort softly and the great snake swayed and slithered from his shoulders onto the polished wood chapter two in memorandum harry was bleeding clutching his right hand in his left and swearing under his breath he shouldered open his bedroom door there was a crunch of breaking china he had trodden on a cup of cold tea that had been sitting on the floor outside his bedroom door what the he looked around the landing of number four privet drive was deserted possibly the cup of tea was dudley s idea of a clever booby trap keeping his bleeding hand elevated harry scraped the fragments of cup together with the other hand and threw them into the already crammed bin just visible inside his bedroom door then he tramped across to the bathroom to run his finger under the tap it was stupid pointless irritating beyond belief that he still had four days left of being unable to perform magic but he had to admit to himself that this jagged cut in his finger would have defeated him he had never learned how to repair wounds and now he came to think of it c particularly in light of his immediate plans c this seemed a serious flaw in his magical education making a mental note to ask hermione how it was done he used a large wad of toilet paper to mop up as much of the tea as he could before returning to his bedroom and slamming the door behind him harry had spent the morning completely emptying his school trunk for the first time since he had packed it six years ago at the start of the intervening school years he had merely skimmed off the topmost three quarters of the contents and replaced or updated them leaving a layer of general debris at the bottom c old quills desiccated beetle eyes single socks that no longer fit minutes previously harry had plunged his hand into this mulch experienced a stabbing pain in the fourth finger of his right hand and withdrawn it to see a lot of blood he now proceeded a little more cautiously kneeling down beside the trunk again he groped around in the bottom and after retrieving an old badge that flickered feebly between support cedric diggory and potter stinks a cracked and worn out sneakoscope and a gold locket inside which a note signed r a b had been hidden he finally discovered the sharp edge that had done the damage he recognized it at once it was a two inch long fragment of the enchanted mirror that his dead godfather sirius had given him harry laid it aside and felt cautiously around the trunk for the rest but nothing more remained of his godfather s last gift except powdered glass which clung to the deepest layer of debris like glittering grit harry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which he had cut himself seeing nothing but his own bright green eye reflected back at him then he placed the fragment on top of that morning s daily prophet which lay unread on the bed and attempted to stem the sudden upsurge of bitter memories the stabs of regret and of longing the discovery of the broken mirror had occasioned by attacking the rest of the rubbish in the trunk it took another hour to empty it completely throw away the useless items and sort the remainder in piles according to whether or not he would need them from now on his school and quidditch robes cauldron parchment quills and most of his textbooks were piled in a corner to be left behind he wondered what his aunt and uncle would do with them burn them in the dead of night probably as if they were evidence of some dreadful crime his muggle clothing invisibility cloak potion making kit certain books the photograph album hagrid had once given him a stack of letters and his wand had been repacked into an old rucksack in a front pocket were the marauder s map and the locket with the note signed r a b inside it the locket was accorded this place of honor not because it was valuable c in all usual senses it was worthless c but because of what it had cost to attain it this left a sizable stack of newspapers sitting on his desk beside his snowy owl hedwig one for each of the days harry had spent at privet drive this summer he got up off the floor stretched and moved across to his desk hedwig made no movement as he began to flick through newspapers throwing them into the rubbish pile one by one the owl was asleep or else faking she was angry with harry about the limited amount of time she was allowed out of her cage at the moment as he neared the bottom of the pile of newspapers harry slowed down searching for one particular issue that he knew had arrived shortly after he had returned to privet drive for the summer he remembered that there had been a small mention on the front about the resignation of charity burbage the muggle studies teacher at hogwarts at last he found it turning to page ten he sank into his desk chair and reread the article he had been looking for albus dumbledore remembered by elphias doge i met albus dumbledore at the age of eleven on our first day at hogwarts our mutual attraction was undoubtedly due to the fact that we both felt ourselves to be outsiders i had contracted dragon pox shortly before arriving at school and while i was no longer contagious my pock marked visage and greenish hue did not encourage many to approach me for his part albus had arrived at hogwarts under the burden of unwanted notoriety scarcely a year previously his father percival had been convicted of a savage and well publicized attack upon three young muggles albus never attempted to deny that his father who was to die in azkaban had committed this crime on the contrary when i plucked up courage to ask him he assured me that he knew his father to be guilty beyond that dumbledore refused to speak of the sad business though many attempted to make him do so some indeed were disposed to praise his father s action and assumed that albus too was a muggle hater they could not have been more mistaken as anybody who knew albus would attest he never revealed the remotest anti muggle tendency indeed his determined support for muggle rights gained him many enemies in subsequent years in a matter of months however albus s own fame had begun to eclipse that of his father by the end of his first year he would never again be known as the son of a muggle hater but as nothing more or less than the most brilliant student ever seen at the school those of us who were privileged to be his friends benefited from his example not to mention his help and encouragement with which he was always generous he confessed to me later in life that he knew even then that his greatest pleasure lay in teaching he not only won every prize of note that the school offered he was soon in regular correspondence with the most notable magical names of the day including nicolas flamel the celebrated alchemist bathilda bagshot the noted historian and adalbert waffling the magical theoretician several of his papers found their way into learned publications such as transfiguration today challenges in charming and the practical potioneer dumbledore s future career seemed likely to be meteoric and the only question that remained was when he would become minister of magic though it was often predicted in later years that he was on the point of taking the job however he never had ministerial ambitions three years after we had started at hogwarts albus s brother aberforth arrived at school they were not alike aberforth was never bookish and unlike albus preferred to settle arguments by dueling rather than through reasoned discussion however it is quite wrong to suggest as some have that the brothers were not friends they rubbed along as comfortably as two such different boys could do in fairness to aberforth it must be admitted that living in albus s shadow cannot have been an altogether comfortable experience being continually outshone was an occupational hazard of being his friend and cannot have been any more pleasurable as a brother when albus and i left hogwarts we intended to take the then traditional tour of the world together visiting and observing foreign wizards before pursuing our separate careers however tragedy intervened on the very eve of our trip albus s mother kendra died leaving albus the head and sole breadwinner of the family i postponed my departure long enough to pay my respects at kendra s funeral then left for what was now to be a solitary journey with a younger brother and sister to care for and little gold left to them there could no longer be any question of albus accompanying me that was the period of our lives when we had least contact i wrote to albus describing perhaps insensitively the wonders of my journey from narrow escapes from chimaeras in greece to the experiments of the egyptian alchemists his letters told me little of his day to day life which i guessed to be frustratingly dull for such a brilliant wizard immersed in my own experiences it was with horror that i heard toward the end of my year s travels that another tragedy had struck the dumbledores the death of his sister ariana though ariana had been in poor health for a long time the blow coming so soon after the loss of their mother had a profound effect on both of her brothers all those closest to albus c and i count myself one of that lucky number c agree that ariana s death and albus s feeling of personal responsibility for it though of course he was guiltless left their mark upon him forevermore i returned home to find a young man who had experienced a much older person s suffering albus was more reserved than before and much less light hearted to add to his misery the loss of ariana had led not to a renewed closeness between albus and aberforth but to an estrangement in time this would lift c in later years they reestablished if not a close relationship then certainly a cordial one however he rarely spoke of his parents or of ariana from then on and his friends learned not to mention them other quills will describe the triumphs of the following years dumbledore s innumerable contributions to the store of wizarding knowledge including his discovery of the twelve uses of dragon s blood will benefit generations to come as will the wisdom he displayed in the many judgments while chief warlock of the wizengamot they say still that no wizarding duel ever matched that between dumbledore and grindelwald in those who witnessed it have written of the terror and the awe they felt as they watched these two extraordinary wizards to battle dumbledore s triumph and its consequences for the wizarding world are considered a turning point in magical history to match the introduction of the international statute of secrecy or the downfall of he who must not be named albus dumbledore was never proud or vain he could find something to value in anyone however apparently insignificant or wretched and i believe that his early losses endowed him with great humanity and sympathy i shall miss his friendship more than i can say but my loss is nothing compared to the wizarding world s that he was the most inspiring and best loved of all hogwarts headmasters cannot be in question he died as he lived working always for the greater good and to his last hour as willing to stretch out a hand to a small boy with dragon pox as he was on the day i met him harry finished reading but continued to gaze at the picture accompanying the obituary dumbledore was wearing his familiar kindly smile but as he peered over the top of his half moon spectacles he gave the impression even in newsprint of x raying harry whose sadness mingled with a sense of humiliation he had thought he knew dumbledore quite well but ever since reading this obituary he had been forced to recognize that he had barely known him at all never once had he imagined dumbledore s childhood or youth it was as though he had sprung into being as harry had known him venerable and silver haired and old the idea of a teenage dumbledore was simply odd like trying to imagine a stupid hermione or a friendly blast ended skrewt he had never thought to ask dumbledore about his past no doubt it would have felt strange impertinent even but after all it had been common knowledge that dumbledore had taken part in that legendary duel with grindelwald and harry had not thought to ask dumbledore what that had been like nor about any of his other famous achievements no they had always discussed harry harry s past harry s future harry s plans and it seemed to harry now despite the fact that his future was so dangerous and so uncertain that he had missed irreplaceable opportunities when he had failed to ask dumbledore more about himself even though the only personal question he had ever asked his headmaster was also the only one he suspected that dumbledore had not answered honestly what do you see when you look in the mirror i i see myself holding a pair of thick woolen socks after several minutes thought harry tore the obituary out of the prophet folded it carefully and tucked it inside the first volume of practical defensive magic and its use against the dark arts then he threw the rest of the newspaper onto the rubbish pile and turned to face the room it was much tidier the only things left out of place were today s daily prophet still lying on the bed and on top of it the piece of broken mirror harry moved across the room slid the mirror fragment off today s prophet and unfolded the newspaper he had merely glanced at the headline when he had taken the rolled up paper from the delivery owl early that morning and thrown it aside after noting that it said nothing about voldemort harry was sure that the ministry was leaning on the prophet to suppress news about voldemort it was only now therefore that he saw what he had missed across the bottom half of the front page a smaller headline was set over a picture of dumbledore striding along looking harried dumbledore c the truth at last coming next week the shocking story of the flawed genius considered by many to be the greatest wizard of his generation striping away the popular image of serene silver bearded wisdom rita skeeter reveals the disturbed childhood the lawless youth the life long feuds and the guilty secrets that dumbledore carried to his grave why was the man tipped to be the minister of magic content to remain a mere headmaster what was the real purpose of the secret organization known as the order of the phoenix how did dumbledore really meet his end the answers to these and many more questions are explored in the explosive new biography the life and lies of albus dumbledore by rita skeeter exclusively interviewed by berry braithwaite page inside harry ripped open the paper and found page thirteen the article was topped with a picture showing another familiar face a woman wearing jeweled glasses with elaborately curled blonde hair her teeth bared in what was clearly supposed to be a winning smile wiggling her fingers up at him doing his best to ignore this nauseating image harry read on in person rita skeeter is much warmer and softer than her famously ferocious quill portraits might suggest greeting me in the hallway of her cozy home she leads me straight into the kitchen for a cup of tea a slice of pound cake and it goes without saying a steaming vat of freshest gossip well of course dumbledore is a biographer s dream says skeeter such a long full life i m sure my book will be the first of very very many skeeter was certainly quick off the mark her nine hundred page book was completed in a mere four weeks after dumbledore s mysterious death in june i ask her how she managed this superfast feat oh when you ve been a journalist as long as i have working to a deadline is second nature i knew that the wizarding world was clamoring for the full story and i wanted to be the first to meet that need i mention the recent widely publicized remarks of elphias doge special advisor to the wizengamot and longstanding friend of albus dumbledore s that skeeter s book contains less fact than a chocolate frog card skeeter throws back her head and laughs darling dodgy i remember interviewing him a few years back about merpeople rights bless him completely gaga seemed to think we were sitting at the bottom of lake windermere kept telling me to watch out for trout and yet elphias doge s accusations of inaccuracy have been echoed in many places does skeeter really feel that four short weeks have been enough to gain a full picture of dumbledore s long and extraordinary life oh my dear beams skeeter rapping me affectionately across the knuckles you know as well as i do how much information can be generated by a fat bag of galleons a refusal to hear the word no and a nice sharp quick quotes quill people were queuing to dish the dirt on dumbledore anyway not everyone thought he was so wonderful you know c he trod on an awful lot of important toes but old dodgy doge can get off his high hippogriff because i ve had access to a source most journalists would swap their wands for one who has never spoken in public before and who was close to dumbledore during the most turbulent and disturbing phase of his youth the advance publicity for skeeter s biography has certainly suggested that there will be shocks in store for those who believe dumbledore to have led a blameless life what were the biggest surprises she uncovered i ask now come off it betty i m not giving away all the highlights before anybody s bought the book laughs skeeter but i can promise that anybody who still thinks dumbledore was white as his beard is in for a rude awakening let s just say that nobody hearing him rage against you know who would have dreamed that he dabbled in the dark arts himself in his youth and for a wizard who spent his later years pleading for tolerance he wasn t exactly broad minded when he was younger yes albus dumbledore had an extremely murky past not to mention that very fishy family which he worked so hard to keep hushed up i ask whether skeeter is referring to dumbledore s brother aberforth whose conviction by the wizengamot for misuse of magic caused a minor scandal fifteen years ago oh aberforth is just the tip of the dung heap laughs skeeter no no i m talking about much worse than a brother with a fondness for fiddling about with goats worse even than the muggle maiming father c dumbledore couldn t keep either of them quiet anyway they were both charged by the wizengamot no it s the mother and the sister that intrigued me and a little digging uncovered a positive nest of nastiness c but as i say you ll have to wait for chapters nine to twelve for full details all i can say now is it s no wonder dumbledore never talked about how his nose got broken family skeletons notwithstanding does skeeter deny the brilliance that led to dumbledore s many magical discoveries he had brains she concedes although many now question whether he could really take full credit for all of his supposed achievements as i reveal in chapter sixteen ivor dillonsby claims he had already discovered eight uses of dragon s blood when dumbledore borrowed his papers but the importance of some of dumbledore s achievements cannot i venture be denied what of his famous defeat of grindelwald oh now i m glad you mentioned grindelwald says skeeter with such a tantalizing smile i m afraid those who go dewy eyed over dumbledore s spectacular victory must brace themselves for a bombshell c or perhaps a dungbomb very dirty business indeed all i ll say is don t be so sure that there really was a spectacular duel of legend after they ve read my book people may be forced to conclude that grindelwald simply conjured a white handkerchief from the end of his wand and came quietly skeeter refuses to give any more away on this intriguing subject so we turn instead to the relationship that will undoubtedly fascinate her readers more than any other oh yes says skeeter nodding briskly i devote an entire chapter to the whole potter dumbledore relationship it s been called unhealthy even sinister again your readers will have to buy my book for the whole story but there is no question that dumbledore took an unnatural interest in potter from the word go whether that was really in the boy s best interests c well we ll see it s certainly an open secret that potter has had a most troubled adolescence i ask whether skeeter is still in touch with harry potter whom she so famously interviewed last year a breakthrough piece in which potter spoke exclusively of his conviction that you know who had returned oh yes we ve developed a closer bond says skeeter poor potter has few real friends and we met at one of the most testing moments of his life c the triwizard tournament i am probably one of the only people alive who can say that they know the real harry potter which leads us neatly to the many rumors still circulating about dumbledore s final hours does skeeter believe that potter was there when dumbledore died well i don t want to say too much c it s all in the book c but eyewitnesses inside hogwarts castle saw potter running away from the scene moments after dumbledore fell jumped or was pushed potter later gave evidence against severus snape a man against whom he has a notorious grudge is everything as it seems that is for the wizarding community to decide c once they ve read my book on that intriguing note i take my leave there can be no doubt that skeeter has quilled an instant bestseller dumbledore s legion of admirers meanwhile may well be trembling at what is soon to emerge about their hero harry reached the bottom of the article but continued to stare blankly at the page revulsion and fury rose in him like vomit he balled up the newspaper and threw it with all his force at the wall where it joined the rest of the rubbish heaped around his overflowing bin he began to stride blindly around the room opening empty drawers and picking up books only to replace them on the same piles barely conscious of what he was doing as random phrases from rita s article echoed in his head an entire chapter to the whole potter dumbledore relationship it s been called unhealthy even sinister he dabbled in the dark arts himself in his youth i ve had access to a source most journalists would swap their wands for lies harry bellowed and through the window he saw the next door neighbor who had paused to restart his lawn mower look up nervously harry sat down hard on the bed the broken bit of mirror danced away from him he picked it up and turned it over in his fingers thinking thinking of dumbledore and the lies with which rita skeeter was defaming him a flash of brightest blue harry froze his cut finger slipping on the jagged edge of the mirror again he had imagined it he must have done he glanced over his shoulder but the wall was a sickly peach color of aunt petunia s choosing there was nothing blue there for the mirror to reflect he peered into the mirror fragment again and saw nothing but his own bright green eye looking back at him he had imagined it there was no other explanation imagined it because he had been thinking of his dead headmaster if anything was certain it was that the bright blue eyes of albus dumbledore would never pierce him again chapter three the dursleys departing the sound of the front door slamming echoed up the stairs and a voice roared oh you sixteen years of being addressed thus left harry in no doubt when his uncle was calling nevertheless he did not immediately respond he was still at the narrow fragment in which for a split second he had thought he saw dumbledore s eye it was not until his uncle bellowed boy that harry got slowly out of bed and headed for the bedroom door pausing to add the piece of broken mirror to the rucksack filled with things he would be taking with him you took you time roared vernon dursley when harry appeared at the top of the stairs get down here i want a word harry strolled downstairs his hands deep in his pants pockets when he searched the living room he found all three dursleys they were dressed for packing uncle vernon in an old ripped up jacket and dudley harry s large blond muscular cousin in his leather jacket yes asked harry sit down said uncle vernon harry raised his eyebrows please added uncle vernon wincing slightly as though the word was sharp in his throat harry sat he though he knew what was coming his uncle began to pace up and down aunt petunia and dudley following his movement with anxious expressions finally his large purple face crumpled with concentration uncle vernon stopped in front of harry and spoke i ve changed my mind he said what a surprise said harry don t you take that tone began aunt petunia in a shrill voice but vernon dursley waved her down it s all a lot of claptrap said uncle vernon glaring at harry with piggy little eyes i ve decided i don t believe a word of it we re staying put we re not going anywhere harry looked up at his uncle and felt a mixture of exasperation and amusement vernon dursley had been changing his mind every twenty four hours for the past four weeks packing and unpacking and repacking the car with every change of heart harry s favorite moment had been the one when uncle vernon unaware the dudley had added his dumbbells to his case since the last time it been repacked had attempted to hoist it back into the boot and collapsed with a yelp of pain and much swearing according to you vernon dursley said now resuming his pacing up and down the living room we c petunia dudley and i c are in danger from c from c some of my lot right said harry well i don t believe it repeated uncle vernon coming to a halt in front of harry again i was awake half the night thinking it all over and i believe it s a plot to get the house the house repeated harry what house this house shrieked uncle vernon the vein his forehead starting to pulse our house house prices are skyrocketing around here you want us out of the way and then you re going to do a bit of hocus pocus and before we know it the deeds will be in your name and c are you out of your mind demanded harry a plot to get this house are you actually as stupid as you look don t you dare squealed aunt petunia but again vernon waved her down slights on his personal appearance were it seemed as nothing to the danger he had spotted just in case you ve forgotten said harry i ve already got a house my godfather left me one so why would i want this one all the happy memories there was silence harry thought he had rather impressed his uncle with this argument you claim said uncle vernon starting to pace yet again that this lord thing c voldemort said harry impatiently and we ve been through this about a hundred times already this isn t a claim it s fact dumbledore told you last year and kingsley and mr weasley c vernon dursley hunched his shoulders angrily and harry guessed that his uncle was attempting to ward off recollections of the unannounced visit a few days into harry s summer holidays of two fully grown wizards the arrival on the doorstep of kingsley shacklebolt and arthur weasley had come as a most unpleasant shock to the dursleys harry had to admit however that as mr weasley had once demolished half of the living room his reappearance could not have been expected to delight uncle vernon kingsley and mr weasley explained it all as well harry pressed on remorselessly once i m seventeen the protective charm that keeps me safe will break and that exposes you as well as me the order is sure voldemort will target you whether to torture you to try and find out where i am or because he thinks by holding you hostage i d come and try to rescue you uncle vernon s and harry s eyes met harry was sure that in that instant they were both wondering the same thing then uncle vernon walked on and harry resumed you ve got to go into hiding and the order wants to help you re being offered serious protection the best there is uncle vernon said nothing but continued to pace up and down outside the sun hung low over the privet hedges the next door neighbor s lawn mower stalled again i thought there was a ministry of magic asked vernon dursley abruptly there is said harry surprised well then why can t they protect us it seems to me that as innocent victims guilty of nothing more than harboring a marked man we ought to qualify for government protection harry laughed he could not help himself it was so very typical of his uncle to put his hopes in the establishment even within this world that he despised and mistrusted you heard what mr weasley and kingsley said harry replied we think the ministry has been infiltrated uncle vernon strode back to the fireplace and back breathing so strongly that his great black mustache rippled his face still purple with concentration all right he said stopping in front of harry get again all right let s say for the sake of argument we accept this protection i still don t see why we can t have that kingsley bloke harry managed not to roll his eyes but with difficulty this question had also been addressed half a dozen times as i ve told you he said through gritted teeth kingsley is protecting the mug c i mean your prime minister exactly c he s the best said uncle vernon pointing at the blank television screen the dursleys had spotted kingsley on the news walking along the muggle prime minister as he visited a hospital this and the fact that kingsley had mastered the knack of dressing like a muggle not to mention a certain reassuring something in his slow deep voice had caused the dursleys to take to kingsley in a way that they had certainly not done with any other wizard although it was true that they had never seen him with earring in well he s taken said harry but hestia jones and dedalus diggle are more than up to the job c if we d even seen cvs began uncle vernon but harry lost patience getting to his feet he advanced on his uncle not pointing at the tv set himself these accidents aren t accidents c the crashed and explosions and derailments and whatever else has happened since we last watched the news people are disappearing and dying and he s behind it c voldemort i ve told you this over and over again he kills muggles for fun even the fogs c they re caused by dementors and if you can t remember what they are ask your son dudley s hands jerked upward to tower his mouth with his parents and harry s eyes upon him he slowly lowered them again and asked there are more of them more laughed harry more than the two that attacked us you mean of course there are hundreds maybe thousands by this time seeing as they feed off fear and despair all right all right blustered blustered vernon dursley you ve made your point c i hope so said harry because once i m seventeen all of them c death eaters elementors maybe even inferi c which means dead bodies enchanted by a dark wizard c will be able to find you and will certainly attack you and if you remember the last time you tried to outrun wizards i think you ll agree you need help there was a brief silence in which the distant echo of hagrid smashing down a wooden front door seemed to reverberate through the intervening years aunt petunia was looking at uncle vernon dudley was staring at harry finally uncle vernon blurted out but what about my work what about dudley s school i don t suppose those things matter to a bunch of layabout wizards c don t you understand shouted harry they will torture and kill you like they did my parents dad said dudley in a loud voice dad c i m going with these order people dudley said harry for the first time in your life you re talking sense he knew the battle was won if dudley was frightened enough to accept the order s help his parents would accompany him there could be no question of being separated from their duddykins harry glanced at the carriage clock on the mantelpiece they ll be here in about five minutes he said and when one of the dursleys replied he left the room the prospect of parting probably forever c from his aunt uncle and cousin was one that he was able to contemplate quite cheerfully but there was nevertheless a certain awkwardness in the air what did you say to one another at the end of sixteen years solid dislike back in his bedroom harry fiddled aimlessly with his rucksack then poked a couple of owl nuts through the bats of hedwig s cage they fell with dull thuds to the bottom where she ignored them we re leaving soon really soon harry told her and then you ll be able to fly again the doorbell rang harry hesitated then headed back out of his room and downstairs it was too much to expect hestia and dedalus to cope with the dursleys on their own harry potter squeaked an excited voice the moment harry had opened the door a small man in a mauve top hat that was sweeping him a deep bow an honor as ever thanks dedalus said harry bestowing a small and embarrassed smile upon the dark haired hestia it s really good of you to do this they re through here my aunt and uncle and cousin good day to you harry potter s relatives said dedalus happily striding into the living room the dursleys did not look at all happy to be addressed thus harry half expected another change of mind dudley shrank neared to his mother at the sight of the witch and wizard i see you are packed and ready excellent the plan as harry has told you is a simple one said dedalus pulling an immense pocket watch out of his waistcoat and examining it we shall be leaving before harry does due to the danger of using magic in your house charry being still underage it could provide the ministry with an excuse to arrest him c we shall be driving say ten miles or so before disapparating to the safe location we have picked out for you you know how to drive i take it he asked uncle vernon politely know how to c of course i ruddy well know how to drive spluttered uncle vernon very clever of you sir very clever i personally would be utterly bamboozled by all those buttons and knobs said dedalus he was clearly under the impression that he was flattering vernon dursley who was visibly losing confidence in the plan with every word dedalus spoke can t even drive he muttered under his breath his mustache rippling indignantly but fortunately neither dedalus nor hestia seemed to hear him you harry dedalus continued will wait here for your guard there has been a little change in the arrangements c what d you mean said harry at once i thought mad eye was going to come and take me by side along apparition can t do it said hestia tersely mad eye will explain the dursleys who had listened to all of this with looks of utter incomprehension on their faces jumped as a loud voice screeched hurry up harry looked all around the room before realizing the voice had issued from dedalus s pocket watch quite right were operating to a very tight schedule said dedalus nodding at his watch and tucking it back into his waist coat we are attempting to time your departure from the house with your family s disapparition harry thus the charm breaks the moment you all head for safety he turned to the dursleys well are we all packed and ready to go none of them answered him uncle vernon was still staring appalled at the bulge in dedalus s waistcoat pocket perhaps we should wait outside in the hall dedalus murmured hestia she clearly felt that it would be tactless for them to remain the room while harry and the dursleys exchanged loving possibly tearful farewells there s no need harry muttered but uncle vernon made any further explanation unnecessary by saying loudly well this is good bye then boy he swung his right arm upward to shake harry s hand but at the last moment seemed unable to face it and merely closed his fist and began swinging it backward and forward like a metronome ready duddy asked petunia fussily checking the clasp of her handbag so as to avoid looking at harry altogether dudley did not answer but stood there with his mouth slightly ajar reminding harry a little of the giant grawp come along then said uncle vernon he had already reached the living room door when dudley mumbled i don t understand what don t you understand popkin asked petunia looking up at her son dudley raised a large hamlike hand to point at harry why isn t he coming with us uncle vernon and aunt petunia froze when they stood staring at dudley as though he had just expressed a desire to become a ballerina what said uncle vernon loudly why isn t he coming too asked dudley well he doesn t want to said uncle vernon turning to glare at harry and adding you don t want to do you not in the slightest said harry there you are uncle vernon told dudley now come on we re off he marched out of the room they heard the front door open but dudley did not move and after a few faltering steps aunt petunia stopped too what now barked uncle vernon reappearing in the doorway it seemed that dudley was struggling with concepts too difficult to put into words after several moments of apparently painful internal struggle he said but where s he going to go aunt petunia and uncle vernon looked at each other it was clear that dudley was frightening them hestia jones broke the silence but surely you know where your nephew is going she asked looking bewildered certainly we know said vernon dursley he s off with some of your lot isn t he right dudley let s get in the car you heard the man we re in a hurry again vernon dursley marched as far as the front door but dudley did not follow off with some of our lot hestia looked outraged harry had met this attitude before witches and wizards seemed stunned that his closed living relatives took so little interest in the famous harry potter it s fine harry assured her it doesn t matter honestly doesn t matter repeated hestia her voice rising considerably don t these people realize what you ve been through what danger you are in the unique position you hold in the hearts of the anti voldemort movement er cno they don t said harry they think i m a waste of space actually but i m used to c i don t think you re a waste of space if harry had not seen dudley s lips move he might not have believed it as it was he stared at dudley for several seconds before accepting that it must have been his cousin who had spoken for one thing dudley had turned red harry was embarrassed and astonished himself well er thanks dudley again dudley appeared to grapple with thoughts too unwieldy for expression before mumbling you saved my life not really said harry it was your soul the dementor would have taken he looked curiously at his cousin they had had virtually no contact during this summer or last as harry had come back to privet drive so briefly and kept to his room so much it now dawned on harry however that the cup of cold tea on which he had trodden that morning might not have been a booby trap at all although rather touched he was nevertheless quite relieved that dudley appeared to have exhausted his ability to express his feelings after opening his mouth once or twice more dudley subsided into scarlet faced silence aunt petunia burst into tears hestia jones gave her an approving look that changed to outrage as aunt petunia ran forward and embraced dudley rather than harry s so sweet dudders she sobbed into his massive chest s such a lovely b boy s saying thank you but he hasn t said thank you at all said hestia indignantly he only said he didn t think harry was a waste of space yea but coming from dudley that s like i love you said harry torn between annoyance and a desire to laugh as aunt petunia continued to clutch at dudley as if he had just saved harry from a burning building are we going or not roared uncle vernon reappearing yet again at the living room door i thought we were on a tight schedule yes cyes we are said dedalus diggle who had been watching these exchanged with an air of bemusement and now seemed to pull himself together we really must be off harry c he tripped forward and wrung harry s hand with both of his own good luck i hope we meet again the hopes of the wizarding world rest upon your shoulders oh said harry right thanks farwell harry said hestia also clasping his hand our thoughts go with you i hope everything s okay said harry with a glance toward aunt petunia and dudley oh i m sure we shall end up the best of chums said diggle slightly waving his hat as he left the room hestia followed him dudley gently released himself from his mother s clutches and walked toward harry who had to repress an urge to threaten him with magic then dudley held out his large pink hand blimey dudley said harry over aunt petunia s renewed sobs did the dementors blow a different personality into you dunno muttered dudley see you harry yea said harry raking dudley s hand and shaking it maybe take care big d dudley nearly smiled they lumbered from the room harry heard his heavy footfalls on the graveled drive and then a car door slammed aunt petunia whose face had been buried in her handkerchief looked around at the sound she did not seem to have expected to find herself alone with harry hastily stowing her wet handkerchief into her pocket she said well c good bye and marched towards the door without looking at him good bye said harry she stopped and looked back for a moment harry had the strangest feeling that she wanted to say something to him she gave him an odd tremulous look and seemed to teeter on the edge of speech but then with a little of her head she hustled out of the room after he husband and son chapter four the seven potters harry ran back upstairs to his bedroom arriving at the window just in time to see the dursleys car swinging out of the drive and off up the road dedalus s top hat was visible between aunt petunia and dudley in the backseat the car turned right at the end of privet drive its windows burned scarlet for a moment in the now setting sun and then it was gone harry picked up hedwig s cage his firebolt and his rucksack gave his unnaturally tidy bedroom one last sweeping look and then made his ungainly way back downstairs to the hall where he deposited cage broomstick and bag near the foot of the stairs the light was fading rapidly the hall full of shadows in the evening light it felt most strange to stand here in the silence and know that he was about to leave the house for the last time long ago when he had been left alone while the dursleys went out to enjoy themselves the hours of solitude had been a rare treat pausing only to sneak something tasty from the fridge he had rushed upstairs to play on dudley s computer or put on the television and flicked through the channels to his heart s content it gave him an odd empty feeling remembering those times it was like remembering a younger brother whom he had lost don t you want to take a last look at the place he asked hedwig who was still sulking with her head under her wing we ll never be here again don t you want to remember all the good times i mean look at this doormat what memories dudley sobbed on it after i saved him from the dementors turns out he was grateful after all can you believe it and last summer dumbledore walked through that front door harry lost the thread of his thoughts for a moment and hedwig did nothing to help him retrieve it but continued to sit with her head under her wing harry turned his back on the front door and under here hedwig c harry pulled open a door under the stairs c is where i used to sleep you never knew me then c blimey it s small i d forgotten harry looked around at the stacked shoes and umbrellas remembering how he used to wake every morning looking up at the underside of the staircase which was more often than not adorned with a spider or two those had been the days before he had known anything about his true identity before he had found out how his parents had died or why such strange things often happened around him but harry could still remember the dreams that had dogged him even in those days confused dreams involving flashes of green light and once c uncle vernon had nearly crashed the car when harry had recounted it c a flying motorbike there was a sudden deafening roar from somewhere nearby harry straightened up with a jerk and smacked the top of his head on the low door frame pausing only to employ a few of uncle vernon s choicest swear words he staggered back into the kitchen clutching his head and staring out of the window into the back garden the darkness seemed to be rippling the air itself quivering then one by one figures began to pop into sight as their disillusionment charms lifted dominating the scene was hagrid wearing a helmet and goggles and sitting astride an enormous motorbike with a black sidecar attached all around him other people were dismounting from brooms and in two cases skeletal black winged horses wrenching open the back door harry hurtled into their midst there was a general cry of greeting as hermione flung her arms around him ron clapped him on the back and hagrid said all righ harry ready fer the off definitely said harry beaming around at them all but i wasn t expecting this many of you change of plan growled mad eye who was holding two enormous bulging sacks and whose magical eye was spinning from darkening sky to house to garden with dizzying rapidity let s get undercover before we talk you through it harry led them all back into the kitchen where laughing and chattering they settled on chairs sat themselves upon aunt petunia s gleaming work surfaces or leaned up against her spotless appliances ron long and lanky hermione her bushy hair tied back in a long plait fred and george grinning identically bill badly scarred and long haired mr weasley kind faced balding his spectacles a little awry mad eye battle worn one legged his bright blue magical eye whizzing in its socket tonks whose short hair was her favorite shade of bright pink lupin grayer more lined fleur slender and beautiful with her long silvery blonde hair kingsley bald and broad shouldered hagrid with his wild hair and beard standing hunchbacked to avoid hitting his head on the ceiling and mundungus fletcher small dirty and hangdog with his droopy beady hound s eyes and matted hair harry s heart seemed to expand and glow at the sight he felt incredibly fond of all of them even mundungus whom he had tried to strangle the last time they had met kingsley i thought you were looking after the muggle prime minister he called across the room he can get along without me for one night said kingsley you re more important harry guess what said tonks from her perch on top of the washing machine and she wiggled her left hand at him a ring glistened there you got married harry yelped looking from her to lupin i m sorry you couldn t be there harry it was very quiet that s brilliant congrat c all right all right we ll have time for a cozy catch up later roared moody over the hubbub and silence fell in the kitchen moody dropped his sacks at his feet and turned to harry as dedalus probably told you we had to abandon plan a pius thicknesse has gone over which gives us a big problem he s made it an imprisonable offense to connect this house to the floo network place a portkey here or apparate in or out all done in the name of your protection to prevent you know who getting in at you absolutely pointless seeing as your mother s charm does that already what he s really done is to stop you getting out of here safely second problem you re underage which means you ve still got the trace on you i don t c the trace the trace said mad eye impatiently the charm that detects magical activity around under seventeens the way the ministry finds out about underage magic if you or anyone around you casts a spell to get you out of here thicknesse is going to know about it and so will the death eaters we can t wait for the trace to break because the moment you turn seventeen you ll lose all the protection your mother gave you in short pius thicknesse thinks he s got you cornered good and proper harry could not help but agree with the unknown thicknesse so what are we going to do we re going to use the only means of transport left to us the only ones the trace can t detect because we don t need to cast spells to use them brooms thestrals and hagrid s motorbike harry could see flaws in this plan however he held his tongue to give mad eye the chance to address them now your mother s charm will only break under two conditions when you come of age or c moody gestured around the pristine kitchen c you no longer call this place home you and your aunt and uncle are going your separate ways tonight in the full understanding that you re never going to live together again correct harry nodded so this time when you leave there ll be no going back and the charm will break the moment you get outside its range we re choosing to break it early because the alternative is waiting for you know who to come and seize you the moment you turn seventeen the one thing we ve got on our side is that you know who doesn t know we re moving you tonight we ve leaked a fake trail to the ministry they think you re not leaving until the thirtieth however this is you know who we re dealing with so we can t rely on him getting the date wrong he s bound to have a couple of death eaters patrolling the skies in this general area just in case so we ve given a dozen different houses every protection we can throw at them they all look like they could be the place we re going to hide you they ve all got some connection with the order my house kingsley s place molly s auntie muriel s c you get the idea yeah said harry not entirely truthfully because he could still spot a gaping hole in the plan you ll be going to tonks s parents once you re within the boundaries of the protective enchantments we ve put on their house you ll be able to use a portkey to the burrow any questions er c yes said harry maybe they won t know which of the twelve secure houses i m heading for at first but won t it be sort of obvious once c he performed a quick headcount c fourteen of us fly off toward tonks s parents ah said moody i forgot to mention the key point fourteen of us won t be flying to tonks s parents there will be seven harry potters moving through the skies tonight each of them with a companion each pair heading for a different safe house from inside his cloak moody now withdrew a flask of what looked like mud there was no need for him to say another word harry understood the rest of the plan immediately no he said loudly his voice ringing through the kitchen no way i told them you d take it like this said hermione with a hint of complacency if you think i m going to let six people risk their lives because it s the first time for all of us said ron this is different pretending to be me c well none of us really fancy it harry said fred earnestly imagine if something went wrong and we were stuck as specky scrawny gits forever harry did not smile you can t do it if i don t cooperate you need me to give you some hair well that s the plan scuppered said george obviously there s no chance at all of us getting a bit of your hair unless you cooperate yeah thirteen of us against one bloke who s not allowed to use magic we ve got no chance said fred funny said harry really amusing if it has to come to force then it will growled moody his magical eye now quivering a little in its socket as he glared at harry everyone here s overage potter and they re all prepared to take the risk mundungus shrugged and grimaced the magical eye swerved sideways to glance at him out of the side of moody s head let s have no more arguments time s wearing on i want a few of your hairs boy now but this is mad there s no need c no need snarled moody with you know who out there and half the ministry on his side potter if we re lucky he ll have swallowed the fake bait and he ll be planning to ambush you on the thirtieth but he d be mad not to have a death eater or two keeping an eye out it s what i d do they might not be able to get at you or this house while your mother s charm holds but it s about to break and they know the rough position of the place our only chance is to use decoys even you know who can t split himself into seven harry caught hermione s eye and looked away at once so potter c some of your hair if you please harry glanced at ron who grimaced at him in a just do it sort of way now barked moody with all of their eyes upon him harry reached up to the top of his head grabbed a hank of hair and pulled good said moody limping forward as he pulled the stopper out of the flask of potion straight in here if you please harry dropped the hair into the mudlike liquid the moment it made contact with its surface the potion began to froth and smoke then all at once it turned a clear bright gold ooh you look much tastier than crabbe and goyle harry said hermione before catching sight of ron s raised eyebrows blushing slightly and saying oh you know what i mean c goyle s potion tasted like bogies right then fake potters line up over here please said moody ron hermione fred george and fleur lined up in front of aunt petunia s gleaming sink we re one short said lupin here said hagrid gruffly and he lifted mundungus by the scruff of the neck and dropped him down beside fleur who wrinkled her nose pointedly and moved along to stand between fred and george instead i m a soldier i d sooner be a protector said mundungus shut it growled moody as i ve already told you you spineless worm any death eaters we run into will be aiming to capture potter not kill him dumbledore always said you know who would want to finish potter in person it ll be the protectors who have got the most to worry about the death eaters ll want to kill them mundungus did not look particularly reassured but moody was already pulling half a dozen eggcup sized glasses from inside his cloak which he handed out before pouring a little polyjuice potion into each one altogether then ron hermione fred george fleur and mundungus drank all of them gasped and grimaced as the potion hit their throats at once their features began to bubble and distort like hot wax hermione and mundungus were shooting upward ron fred and george were shrinking their hair was darkening hermione s and fleur s appearing to shoot backward into their skulls moody quite unconcerned was now loosening the ties of the large sacks he had brought with him when he straightened up again there were six harry potters gasping and panting in front of him fred and george turned to each other and said together wow c we re identical i dunno though i think i m still better looking said fred examining his reflection in the kettle bah said fleur checking herself in the microwave door bill don t look at me c i m ideous those whose clothes are a bit roomy i ve got smaller here said moody indicating the first sack and vice versa don t forget the glasses there s six pairs in the side pocket and when you re dressed there s luggage in the other sack the real harry thought that this might just be the most bizarre thing he had ever seen and he had seen some extremely odd things he watched as his six doppelgangers rummaged in the sacks pulling out sets of clothes putting on glasses stuffing their own things away he felt like asking them to show a little more respect for privacy as they all began stripping off with impunity clearly more at ease with displaying his body than they would have been with their own i knew ginny was lying about that tattoo said ron looking down at his bare chest harry your eyesight really is awful said hermione as she put on glasses once dressed the fake harrys took rucksacks and owl cages each containing a stuffed snowy owl from the second sack good said moody as at last seven dressed bespectacled and luggage laden harrys faced him the pairs will be as follows mundungus will be traveling with me by broom c why m i with you grunted the harry nearest the back door because you re the one that needs watching growled moody and sure enough his magical eye did not waver from mundungus as he continued arthur and fred c i m george said the twin at whom moody was pointing can t you even tell us apart when we re harry sorry george c i m only yanking your wand i m fred really c enough messing around snarled moody the other one c george or fred or whoever you are c you re with remus miss delacour c i m taking fleur on a thestral said bill she s not that fond of brooms fleur walked over to stand beside him giving him a soppy slavish look that harry hoped with all his heart would never appear on his face again miss granger with kingsley again by thestral c hermione looked reassured as she answered kingsley s smile harry knew that hermione too lacked confidence on a broomstick which leaves you and me ron said tonks brightly knocking over a mug tree as she waved at him ron did not look quite as pleased as hermione an you re with me harry that all righ said hagrid looking a little anxious we ll be on the bike brooms an thestrals can t take me weight see not a lot o room on the seat with me on it though so you ll be in the sidecar that s great said harry not altogether truthfully we think the death eaters will expect you to be on a broom said moody who seemed to guess how harry was feeling snape s had plenty of time to tell them everything about you he s never mentioned before so if we do run into any death eaters we re betting they ll choose one of the potters who looks at home on a broomstick all right then he went on tying up the sack with the fake potters clothes in it and leading the way back to the door i make it three minutes until we re supposed to leave no point locking the back door it won t keep the death eaters out when they come looking come on harry hurried to gather his rucksack firebolt and hedwig s cage and followed the group to the dark back garden on every side broomsticks were leaping into hands hermione had already been helped up onto a great black thestral by kingsley fleur onto the other by bill hagrid was standing ready beside the motorbike goggles on is this it is this sirius s bike the very same said hagrid beaming down at harry an the last time yeh was on it harry i could fit yeh in one hand harry could not help but feel a little humiliated as he got into the sidecar it placed him several feet below everybody else ron smirked at the sight of him sitting there like a child in a bumper car harry stuffed his rucksack and broomstick down by his feet and rammed hedwig s cage between his knees he was extremely uncomfortable arthur s done a bit o tinkerin said hagrid quite oblivious to harry s discomfort he settled himself astride the motorcycle which creaked slightly and sank inches into the ground it s got a few tricks up its sleeves now tha one was my idea he pointed a thick finger at a purple button near the speedometer please be careful hagrid said mr weasley who was standing beside them holding his broomstick i m still not sure that was advisable and it s certainly only to be used in emergencies all right then said moody everyone ready please i want us all to leave at exactly the same time or the whole point of the diversion s lost everybody motioned their heads hold tight now ron said tonks and harry saw ron throw a forcing guilty look at lupin before placing his hands on each side of her waist hagrid kicked the motorbike into life it roared like a dragon and the sidecar began to vibrate good luck everyone shouted moody see you all in about an hour at the burrow on the count of three one two three there was a great roar from the motorbike and harry felt the sidecar give a nasty lurch he was rising through the air fast his eyes watering slightly hair whipped back off his face around him brooms were soaring upward too the long black tail of a thestral flicked past his legs jammed into the sidecar by hedwig s cage and his rucksack were already sore and starting to go numb so great was his discomfort that he almost forgot to take a last glimpse of number four privet drive by the time he looked over the edge of the sidecar he could no longer tell which one it was and then out of nowhere out of nothing they were surrounded at least thirty hooded figures suspended in midair formed a vast circle in the middle of which the order members had risen oblivious c screams a blaze of green light on every side hagrid gave a yell and the motorbike rolled over harry lost any sense of where they were streetlights above him yells around him he was clinging to the sidecar for dear life hedwig s cage the firebolt and his rucksack slipped from beneath his knees c no c help the broomstick spun too but he just managed to seize the strap of his rucksack and the top of the cage as the motorbike swung the right way up again a second s relief and then another burst of green light the owl screeched and fell to the floor of the cage no c no the motorbike zoomed forward harry glimpsed hooded death eaters scattering as hagrid blasted through their circle hedwig c hedwig c but the owl lay motionless and pathetic as a toy on the floor of her cage he could not take it in and his terror for the others was paramount he glanced over his shoulder and saw a mass of people moving flares of green light two pairs of people on brooms soaring off into the distance but he could not tell who they were c hagrid we ve got to go back we ve got to go back he yelled over the thunderous roar of the engine pulling out his wand ramming hedwig s cage into the floor refusing to believe that she was dead hagrid turn around my job s ter get you there safe harry bellow hagrid and he opened the throttle stop c stop harry shouted but as he looked back again two jets of green light flew past his left ear four death eaters had broken away from the circle and were pursuing them aiming for hagrid s broad back hagrid swerved but the death eaters were keeping up with the bike more curses shot after them and harry had to sink low into the sidecar to avoid them wriggling around he cried stupefy and a red bolt of light shot from his own wand cleaving a gap between the four pursuing death eaters as they scattered to avoid it hold on harry this ll do for em roared hagrid and harry looked up just in time to see hagrid slamming a thick finger into a green button near the fuel gauge a wall a solid black wall erupted out of the exhaust pipe craning his neck harry saw it expand into being in midair three of the death eaters swerved and avoided it but the fourth was not so lucky he vanished from view and then dropped like a boulder from behind it his broomstick broken into pieces one of his fellows slowed up to save him but they and the airborne wall were swallowed by darkness as hagrid leaned low over the handlebars and sped up more killing curses flew past harry s head from the two remaining death eaters wands they were aiming for hagrid harry responded with further stunning spells red and green collided in midair in a shower of multicolored sparks and harry thought wildly of fireworks and the muggles below who would have no idea what was happening c here we go again harry hold on yelled hagrid and he jabbed at a second button this time a great net burst from the bike s exhaust but the death eaters were ready for it not only did they swerve to avoid it but the companion who had slowed to save their unconscious friend had caught up he bloomed suddenly out of the darkness and now three of them were pursuing the motorbike all shooting curses after it this ll do it harry hold on tight yelled hagrid and harry saw him slam his whole hand onto the purple button beside the speedometer with an unmistakable bellowing roar dragon fire burst from the exhaust white hot and blue and the motorbike shot forward like a bullet with a sound of wrenching metal harry saw the death eaters swerve out of sight to avoid the deadly trail of flame and at the same time felt the sidecar sway ominously its metal connections to the bike had splintered with the force of acceleration it s all righ harry bellowed hagrid now thrown flat onto the back by the surge of speed nobody was steering now and the sidecar was starting to twist violently in the bike s slipstream i m on it harry don worry hagrid yelled and from inside his jacket pocket he pulled his flowery pink umbrella hagrid no let me reparo there was a deafening bang and the sidecar broke away from the bike completely harry sped forward propelled by the impetus of the bike s flight then the sidecar began to lose height c in desperation harry pointed his wand at the sidecar and shouted wingardium leviosa the sidecar rose like a cork unsteerable but at least still airborne he had but a split second s relief however as more curses streaked past him the three death eaters were closing in i m comin harry hagrid yelled from out of the darkness but harry could feel the sidecar beginning to sink again crouching as low as he could he pointed at the middle of the oncoming figures and yelled impedimenta the jinx hit the middle death eater in the chest for a moment the man was absurdly spread eagled in midair as though he had hit an invisible barrier one of his fellows almost collided with him c then the sidecar began to fall in earnest and the remaining death eater shot a curse so close to harry that he had to duck below the rim of the car knocking out a tooth on the edge of his seat c i m comin harry i m comin a huge hand seized the back of harry s robes and hoisted him out of the plummeting sidecar harry pulled his rucksack with him as he dragged himself onto the motorbike s seat and found himself back to back with hagrid as they soared upward away from the two remaining death eaters harry spat blood out of his mouth pointed his wand at the falling sidecar and yelled confringo he knew a dreadful gut wrenching pang for hedwig as it exploded the death eater nearest it was blasted off his broom and fell from sight his companion fell back and vanished harry i m sorry i m sorry moaned hagrid i shouldn ta tried ter repair it meself c yeh ve got no room c it s not a problem just keep flying harry shouted back as two more death eaters emerged out of the darkness drawing closer as the curses came shooting across the intervening space again hagrid swerved and zigzagged harry knew that hagrid did not dare use the dragon fire button again with harry seated so insecurely harry sent stunning spell after stunning spell back at their pursuers barely holding them off he shot another blocking jinx at them the closest death eater swerved to avoid it and his hood slipped and by the red light of his next stunning spell harry saw the strangely blank face of stanley shunpike c stan c expelliarmus harry yelled that s him it s him it s the real one the hooded death eater s shout reached harry even above the thunder of the motorbike s engine next moment both pursuers had fallen back and disappeared from view harry what s happened bellowed hagrid where ve they gone i don t know but harry was afraid the hooded death eater had shouted it s the real one how had he known he gazed around at the apparently empty darkness and felt its menace where were they he clambered around on the seat to face forward and seized hold of the back of hagrid s jacket hagrid do the dragon fire thing again let s get out of here hold on tight then harry there was a deafening screeching roar again and the white blue fire shot from the exhaust harry felt himself slipping backwards off what little of the seat he had hagrid flung backward upon him barely maintaining his grip on the handlebars c i think we ve lost em harry i think we ve done it yelled hagrid but harry was not convinced fear lapped at him as he looked left and right for pursuers he was sure would come why had they fallen back one of them had still had a wand it s him it s the real one they had said it right after he had tried to disarm stan we re nearly there harry we ve nearly made it shouted hagrid harry felt the bike drop a little though the lights down on the ground still seemed remote as stars then the scar on his forehead burned like fire as a death eater appeared on either side of the bike two killing curses missed harry by millimeters cast from behind c and then harry saw him voldemort was flying like smoke on the wind without broomstick or thestral to hold him his snake like face gleaming out of the blackness his white fingers raising his wand again c hagrid let out a bellow of fear and steered the motorbike into a vertical dive clinging on for dear life harry sent stunning spells flying at random into the whirling night he saw a body fly past him and knew he had hit one of them but then he heard a bang and saw sparks from the engine the motorbike spiraled through the air completely out of control c green jets of light shot past them again harry had no idea which way was up which down his scar was still burning he expected to die at any second a hooded figure on a broomstick was feet from him he saw it raise its arm c no with a shout of fury hagrid launched himself off the bike at the death eater to his horror harry saw both hagrid and the death eater falling out of sight their combined weight too much for the broomstick c barely gripping the plummeting bike with his knees harry heard voldemort scream mine it was over he could not see or hear where voldemort was he glimpsed another death eater swooping out of the way and heard avada c as the pain from harry s scar forced his eyes shut his wand acted of its own accord he felt it drag his hand around like some great magnet saw a spurt of golden fire through his half closed eyelids heard a crack and a scream of fury the remaining death eater yelled voldemort screamed no somehow harry found his nose an inch from the dragon fire button he punched it with his wand free hand and the bike shot more flames into the air hurtling straight toward the ground hagrid harry called holding on to the bike for dear life hagrid c accio hagrid the motorbike sped up sucked towards the earth face level with the handlebars harry could see nothing but distant lights growing nearer and nearer he was going to crash and there was nothing he could do about it behind him came another scream your wand selwyn give me your wand he felt voldemort before he saw him looking sideways he stared into the red eyes and was sure they would be the last thing he ever saw voldemort preparing to curse him once more c and then voldemort vanished harry looked down and saw hagrid spread eagled on the ground below him he pulled hard at the handlebars to avoid hitting him groped for the brake but with an earsplitting ground trembling crash he smashed into a muddy pond chapter five fallen warrior hagrid harry struggled to raise himself out of the debris of metal and leather that surrounded him his hands sank into inches of muddy water as he tried to stand he could not understand where voldemort had gone and expected him to swoop out of the darkness at any moment something hot and wet was trickling down his chin and from his forehead he crawled out of the pond and stumbled toward the great dark mass on the ground that was hagrid hagrid hagrid talk to me c but the dark mass did not stir who s there is it potter are you harry potter harry did not recognize the man s voice then a woman shouted they ve crashed ted crashed in the garden harry s head was swimming hagrid he repeated stupidly and his knees buckled the next thing he knew he was lying on his back on what felt like cushions with a burning sensation in his ribs and right arm his missing tooth had been regrown the scar on his forehead was still throbbing hagrid he opened his eyes and saw that he was lying on a sofa in an unfamiliar lamplit sitting room his rucksack lay on the floor a short distance away wet and muddy a fair haired big bellied man was watching harry anxiously hagrid s fine son said the man the wife s seeing to him now how are you feeling anything else broken i ve fixed your ribs your tooth and your arm i m ted by the way ted tonks c dora s father harry sat up too quickly lights popped in front of his eyes and he felt sick and giddy voldemort c easy now said ted tonks placing a hand on harry s shoulder and pushing him back against the cushions that was a nasty crash you just had what happened anyway something go wrong with the bike arthur weasley overstretch himself again him and his muggle contraptions no said harry as his scar pulsed like an open wound death eaters loads of them c we were chased c death eaters said ted sharply what d you mean death eaters i thought they didn t know you were being moved tonight i thought c they knew said harry ted tonks looked up at the ceiling as though he could see through it to the sky above well we know our protective charms hold then don t we they shouldn t be able to get within a hundred yards of the place in any direction now harry understood why voldemort had vanished it had been at the point when the motorbike crossed the barrier of the order s charms he only hoped they would continue to work he imagined voldemort a hundred yards above them as they spoke looking for a way to penetrate what harry visualized as a great transparent bubble he swung his legs off the sofa he needed to see hagrid with his own eyes before he would believe that he was alive he had barely stood up however when a door opened and hagrid squeezed through it his face covered in mud and blood limping a little but miraculously alive harry knocking over two delicate tables and an aspidistra he covered the floor between them in two strides and pulled harry into a hug that nearly cracked his newly repaired ribs blimey harry how did yeh get out o that i thought we were both goners yeah me too i can t believe c harry broke off he had just noticed the woman who had entered the room behind hagrid you he shouted and he thrust his hand into his pocket but it was empty your wand s here son said ted tapping it on harry s arm it fell right beside you i picked it up and that s my wife you re shouting at oh i m c i m sorry as she moved forward into the room mrs tonks s resemblance to her sister bellatrix became much less pronounced her hair was a light s oft brown and her eyes were wider and kinder nevertheless she looked a little haughty after harry s exclamation what happened to our daughter she asked hagrid said you were ambushed where is nymphadora i don t know said harry we don t know what happened to anyone else she and ted exchanged looks a mixture of fear and guilt gripped harry at the sight of their expressions if any of the others had died it was his fault all his fault he had consented to the plan given them his hair the portkey he said remembering all of a sudden we ve got to get back to the burrow and find out c then we ll be able to send you word or c or tonks will once she s c dora ll be ok dromeda said ted she knows her stuff she s been in plenty of tight spots with the aurors the portkey s through here he added to harry it s supposed to leave in three minutes if you want to take it yeah we do said harry he seized his rucksack swung it onto his shoulders i c he looked at mrs tonks wanting to apologize for the state of fear in which he left her and for which he felt so terribly responsible but no words occurred to him that he did not seem hollow and insincere i ll tell tonks c dora c to send word when she thanks for patching us up thanks for everything i c he was glad to leave the room and follow ted tonks along a short hallway and into a bedroom hagrid came after them bending low to avoid hitting his head on the door lintel there you go son that s the portkey mr tonks was pointing to a small silver backed hairbrush lying on the dressing table thanks said harry reaching out to place a finger on it ready to leave wait a moment said hagrid looking around harry where s hedwig she she got hit said harry the realization crashed over him he felt ashamed of himself as the tears stung his eyes the owl had been his companion his one great link with the magical world whenever he had been forced to return to the dursleys hagrid reached out a great hand and patted him painfully on the shoulder never mind he said gruffly never mind she had a great old life c hagrid said ted tonks warningly as the hairbrush glowed bright blue and hagrid only just got his forefinger to it in time with a jerk behind the navel as though an invisible hook and line had dragged him forward harry was pulled into nothingness spinning uncontrollably his finger glued to the portkey as he and hagrid hurtled away from mr tonks second later harry s feet slammed onto hard ground and he fell onto his hands and knees in the yard of the burrow he heard screams throwing aside the no longer glowing hairbrush harry stood up swaying slightly and saw mrs weasley and ginny running down the steps by the back door as hagrid who had also collapsed on landing clambered laboriously to his feet harry you are the real harry what happened where are the others cried mrs weasley what d you mean isn t anyone else back harry panted the answer was clearly etched in mrs weasley s pale face the death eaters were waiting for us harry told her we were surrounded the moment we took off c they knew it was tonight c i don t know what happened to anyone else four of them chased us it was all we could do to get away and then voldemort caught up with us c he could hear the self justifying note in his voice the plea for her to understand why he did not know what had happened to her sons but c thank goodness you re all right she said pulling him into a hug he did not feel he deserved haven t go any brandy have yeh molly asked hagrid a little shakily fer medicinal purposes she could have summoned it by magic but as she hurried back toward the crooked house harry knew that she wanted to hide her face he turned to ginny and she answered his unspoken plea for information at once ron and tonks should have been back first but they missed their portkey it came back without them she said pointing at a rusty oil can lying on the ground nearby and that one she pointed at an ancient sneaker should have been dad and fred s they were supposed to be second you and hagrid were third and she checked her watch if they made it george and lupin aught to be back in about a minute mrs weasley reappeared carrying a bottle of brandy which she handed to hagrid he uncorked it and drank it straight down in one mum shouted ginny pointing to a spot several feet away a blue light had appeared in the darkness it grew larger and brighter and lupin and george appeared spinning and then falling harry knew immediately that there was something wrong lupin was supporting george who was unconscious and whose face was covered in blood harry ran forward and seized george s legs together he and lupin carried george into the house and through the kitchen to the living room where they laid him on the sofa as the lamplight fell across george s head ginny gasped and harry s stomach lurched one of george s ears was missing the side of his head and neck were drenched in wet shockingly scarlet blood no sooner had mrs weasley bent over her son that lupin grabbed harry by the upper arm and dragged him none too gently back into the kitchen where hagrid was still attempting to ease his bulk through the back door oi said hagrid indignantly le go of him le go of harry lupin ignored him what creature sat in the corner the first time that harry potter visited my office at hogwarts he said giving harry a small shake answer me a c a grindylow in a tank wasn t it lupin released harry and fell back against a kitchen cupboard wha was tha about roared hagrid i m sorry harry but i had to check said lupin tersely we ve been betrayed voldemort knew that you were being moved tonight and the only people who could have told him were directly involved in the plan you might have been an impostor so why aren you checkin me panted hagrid still struggling with the door you re half giant said lupin looking up at hagrid the polyjuice potion is designed for human use only none of the order would have told voldemort we were moving tonight said harry the idea was dreadful to him he could not believe it of any of them voldemort only caught up with me toward the end he didn t know which one i was in the beginning if he d been in on the plan he d have known from the start i was the one with hagrid voldemort caught up with you said lupin sharply what happened how did you escape harry explained how the death eaters pursuing them had seemed to recognize him as the true harry how they had abandoned the chase how they must have summoned voldemort who had appeared just before he and hagrid had reached the sanctuary of tonks s parents they recognized you but how what had you done i harry tried to remember the whole journey seemed like a blur of panic and confusion i saw stan shunpike you know the bloke who was the conductor on the knight bus and i tried to disarm him instead of c well he doesn t know what he s doing does he he must be imperiused lupin looked aghast harry the time for disarming is past these people are trying to capture and kill you at least stun if you aren t prepared to kill we were hundreds of feet up stan s not himself and if i stunned him and he d fallen he d have died the same as if i d used avada kedavra expelliarmus saved me from voldemort two years ago harry added defiantly lupin was reminding him of the sneering hufflepuff zacharias smith who had jeered at harry for wanting to teach dumbledore s army how to disarm yes harry said lupin with painful restraint and a great number of death eaters witnessed that happening forgive me but it was a very unusual move then under the imminent threat of death repeating it tonight in front of death eaters who either witnessed or heard about the first occasion was close to suicidal so you think i should have killed stan shunpike said harry angrily of course not said lupin but the death eaters c frankly most people c would have expected you to attack back expelliarmus is a useful spell harry but the death eaters seem to think it is your signature move and i urge you not to let it become so lupin was making harry feel idiotic and yet there was still a grain of defiance inside him i won t blast people out of my way just because they re there said harry that s voldemort s job lupin s retort was lost finally succeeding in squeezing through the door hagrid staggered to a chair and sat down it collapsed beneath him ignoring his mingled oaths and apologies harry addressed lupin again will george be okay all lupin s frustration with harry seemed to drain away at the question i think so although there s no chance of replacing his ear not when it s been cursed off c there was a scuffling from outside lupin dived for the back door harry leapt over hagrid s legs and sprinted into the yard two figures had appeared in the yard and as harry ran toward them he realized they were hermione now returning to her normal appearance and kingsley both clutching a bent coat hanger hermione flung herself into harry s arms but kingsley showed no pleasure at the sight of any of them over hermione s shoulder harry saw him raise his wand and point it at lupin s chest the last words albus dumbledore spoke to the pair of us harry is the best hope we have trust him said lupin calmly kingsley turned his wand on harry but lupin said it s him i ve checked all right all right said kingsley stowing his wand back beneath his cloak but somebody betrayed us they knew they knew it was tonight so it seems replied lupin but apparently they did not realize that there would be seven harrys small comfort snarled kingsley who else is back only harry hagrid george and me hermione stifled a little moan behind her hand what happened to you lupin asked kingsley followed by five injured two might ve killed one kingsley reeled off and we saw you know who as well he joined the chase halfway through but vanished pretty quickly remus he can c fly supplied harry i saw him too he came after hagrid and me so that s why he left to follow you said kingsley i couldn t understand why he d vanished but what made him change targets harry behaved a little too kindly to stan shunpike said lupin stan repeated hermione but i thought he was in azkaban kingsley let out a mirthless laugh hermione there s obviously been a mass breakout which the ministry has hushed up travers s hood fell off when i cursed him he s supposed to be inside too but what happened to you remus where s george he lost an ear said lupin lost an repeated hermione in a high voice snape s work said lupin snape shouted harry you didn t say c he lost his hood during the chase sectumsempra was always a specialty of snape s i wish i could say i d paid him back in kind but it was all i could do to keep george on the broom after he was injured he was losing so much blood silence fell between the four of them as they looked up at the sky there was no sign of movement the stars stared back unblinking indifferent unobscured by flying friends where was ron where were fred and mr weasley where were bill fleur tonks mad eye and mundungus harry give us a hand called hagrid hoarsely from the door in which he was stuck again glad of something to do harry pulled him free the headed through the empty kitchen and back into the sitting room where mrs weasley and ginny were still tending to george mrs weasley had staunched his bleeding now and by the lamplight harry saw a clean gaping hole where george s ear had been how is he mrs weasley looked around and said i can t make it grow back not when it s been removed by dark magic but it could ve been so much worse he s alive yeah said harry thank god did i hear someone else in the yard ginny asked hermione and kingsley said harry thank goodness ginny whispered they looked at each other harry wanted to hug her hold on to her he did not even care much that mrs weasley was there but before he could act on the impulse there was a great crash from the kitchen i ll prove who i am kingsley after i ve seen my son now back off if you know what s good for you harry had never heard mr weasley shout like that before he burst into the living room his bald patch gleaming with sweat his spectacles askew fred right behind him both pale but uninjured arthur sobbed mrs weasley oh thank goodness how is he mr weasley dropped to his knees beside george for the first time since harry had known him fred seemed to be lost for words he gaped over the back of the sofa at his twin s wound as if he could not believe what he was seeing perhaps roused by the sound of fred and their father s arrival george stirred how do you feel georgie whispered mrs weasley george s fingers groped for the side of his head saintlike he murmured what s wrong with him croaked fred looking terrified is his mind affected saintlike repeated george opening his eyes and looking up at his brother you see i m holy holey fred geddit mrs weasley sobbed harder than ever color flooded fred s pale face pathetic he told george pathetic with the whole wide world of ear related humor before you you go for holey ah well said george grinning at his tear soaked mother you ll be able to tell us apart now anyway mum he looked around hi harry c you are harry right yeah i am said harry moving closer to the sofa well at least we got you back okay said george why aren t ron and bill huddled round my sickbed they re not back yet george said mrs weasley george s grin faded harry glanced at ginny and motioned to her to accompany him back outside as they walked through the kitchen she said in a low voice ron and tonks should be back by now they didn t have a long journey auntie muriel s not that far from here harry said nothing he had been trying to keep fear at bay ever since reaching the burrow but now it enveloped him seeming to crawl over his skin throbbing in his chest clogging his throat as they walked down the back steps into the dark yard ginny took his hand kingsley was striding backward and forward glancing up at the sky every time he turned harry was reminded of uncle vernon pacing the living room a million years ago hagrid hermione and lupin stood shoulder to shoulder gazing upward in silence none of them looked around when harry and ginny joined their silent vigil the minutes stretched into what might as well have been years the slightest breath of wind made them all jump and turn toward the whispering bush or tree in the hope that one of the missing order members might leap unscathed from its leaves c and then a broom materialized directly above them and streaked toward the ground c it s them screamed hermione tonks landed in a long skid that sent earth and pebbles everywhere remus tonks cried as she staggered off the broom into lupin s arms his face was set and white he seemed unable to speak ron tripped dazedly toward harry and hermione you re okay he mumbled before hermione flew at him and hugged him tightly i thought c i thought c m all right said ron patting her on the back m fine ron was great said tonks warmly relinquishing her hold on lupin wonderful stunned one of the death eaters straight to the head and when you re aiming at a moving target from a flying broom c you did said hermione gazing up at ron with her arms still around his neck always the tone of surprise he said a little grumpily breaking free are we the last back no said ginny we re still waiting for bill and fleur and mad eye and mundungus i m going to tell mum and dad you re okay ron c she ran back inside so what kept you what happened lupin sounded almost angry at tonks bellatrix said tonks she wants me quite as much as she wants harry remus she tried very hard to kill me i just wish i d got her i owe bellatrix but we definitely injured rodolphus then we got to ron s auntie muriel s and we missed our portkey and she was fussing over us c a muscle was jumping in lupin s jaw he nodded but seemed unable to say anything else so what happened to you lot tonks asked turning to harry hermione and kingsley they recounted the stories of their own journeys but all the time the continued absence of bill fleur mad eye and mundungus seemed to lie upon them like a frost its icy bite harder and harder to ignore i m going to have to get back to downing street i should have been there an hour ago said kingsley finally after a last sweeping gaze at the sky let me know when they re back lupin nodded with a wave to the others kingsley walked away into the darkness toward the gate harry thought he heard the faintest pop as kingsley disapparated just beyond the burrow s boundaries mr and mrs weasley came racing down the back steps ginny behind them both parents hugged ron before turning to lupin and tonks thank you said mrs weasley for our sons don t be silly molly said tonks at once how s george asked lupin what s wrong with him piped up ron he s lost c but the end of mrs weasley s sentence was drowned in a general outcry a thestral had just soared into sight and landed a few feet from them bill and fleur slid from its back windswept but unhurt bill thank god thank god c mrs weasley ran forward but the hug bill bestowed upon her was perfunctory looking directly at his father he said mad eye s dead nobody spoke nobody moved harry felt as though something inside him was falling falling through the earth leaving him forever we saw it said bill fleur nodded tear tracks glittering on her cheeks in the light from the kitchen window it happened just after we broke out of the circle mad eye and dung were close by us they were heading north too voldemort c he can fly c went straight for them dung panicked i heard him cry out mad eye tried to stop him but he disapparated voldemort s curse hit mad eye full in the face he fell backward off his broom and c there was nothing we could do nothing we had half a dozen of them on our own tail c bill s voice broke of course you couldn t have done anything said lupin they all stood looking at each other harry could not quite comprehend it mad eye dead it could not be mad eye so tough so brave the consummate survivor at last it seemed to dawn on everyone though nobody said it that there was no point of waiting in the yard anymore and in silence they followed mr and mrs weasley back into the burrow and into the living room where fred and george were laughing together what s wrong said fred scanning their faces as they entered what s happened who s mad eye said mr weasley dead the twins grins turned to grimaces of shock nobody seemed to know what to do tonks was crying silently into a handkerchief she had been close to mad eye harry knew his favorite and his prot g e at the ministry of magic hagrid who had sat down on the floor in the corner where he had most space was dabbing at his eyes with his tablecloth sized handkerchief bill walked over to the sideboard and pulled out a bottle of fire whisky and some glasses here he said and with a wave of his wand eh sent twelve full glasses soaring through the room to each of them holding the thirteenth aloft mad eye mad eye they all said and drank mad eye echoed hagrid a little late with a hiccup the firewhisky seared harry s throat it seemed to burn feeling back into him dispelling the numbness and sense of unreality firing him with something that was like courage so mundungus disappeared said lupin who had drained his own glass in one the atmosphere changed at once everybody looked tense watching lupin both wanting him to go on it seemed to harry and slightly afraid of what they might hear i know what you re thinking said bill and i wondered that too on the way back here because they seemed to be expecting us didn t they but mundungus can t have betrayed us they didn t know there would be seven harrys that confused them the moment we appeared and in case you ve forgotten it was mundungus who suggested that little bit of skullduggery why wouldn t he have told them the essential point i think dung panicked it s as simple as that he didn t want to come in the first place but mad eye made him and you know who went straight for them it was enough to make anyone panic you know who acted exactly as mad eye expected him to sniffed tonks mad eye said he d expect the real harry to be with the toughest most skilled aurors he chased mad eye first and when mundungus gave them away he switched to kingsley yes and zat eez all very good snapped fleur but still eet does not explain ow zey know we were moving arry tonight does eet somebody must ave been careless somebody let slip ze date to an outsider it is ze only explanation for zem knowing ze date but not ze ole plan she glared around at them all tear tracks still etched on her beautiful face silently daring any of them to contradict her nobody did the only sound to break the silence was that of hagrid hiccupping from behind his handkerchief harry glanced at hagrid who had just risked his own life to save harry s c hagrid whom he loved whom he trusted who had once been tricked into giving voldemort crucial information in exchange for a dragon s egg no harry said aloud and they all looked at him surprised the firewhisky seemed to have amplified his voice i mean if somebody made a mistake harry went on and let something slip i know they didn t mean to do it it s not their fault he repeated again a little louder than he would usually have spoken we ve got to trust each other i trust all of you i don t think anyone in this room would ever sell me to voldemort more silence followed his words they were all looking at him harry felt a little hot again and drank some more firewhisky for something to do as he drank he thought of mad eye mad eye had always been scathing about dumbledore s willingness to trust people well said harry said fred unexpectedly year ear ear said george with half a glance at fred the corner of whose mouth twitched lupin was wearing an odd expression as he looked at harry it was close to pitying you think i m a fool demanded harry no i think you re like james said lupin who would have regarded it as the height of dishonor to mistrust his friends harry knew what lupin was getting at that his father had been betrayed by his friend peter pettigrew he felt irrationally angry he wanted to argue but lupin had turned away from him set down his glass upon a side table and addressed bill there s work to do i can ask kingsley whether c no said bill at once i ll do it i ll come where are you going said tonks and fleur together mad eye s body said lupin we need to recover it can t it began mrs weasley with an appealing look at bill wait said bill not unless you d rather the death eaters took it nobody spoke lupin and bill said good bye and left the rest of them now dropped into chairs all except for harry who remained standing the suddenness and completeness of death was with them like a presence i ve got to go too said harry ten pairs of startled eyes looked at him don t be silly harry said mrs weasley what are you talking about i can t stay here he rubbed his forehead it was prickling again he had not hurt like this for more than a year you re all in danger while i m here i don t want c but don t be so silly said mrs weasley the whole point of tonight was to get you here safely and thank goodness it worked and fleur s agreed to get married here rather than in france we ve arranged everything so that we can all stay together and look after you c she did not understand she was making him feel worse not better if voldemort finds out i m here c but why should he asked mrs weasley there are a dozen places you might be now harry said mr weasley he s got no way of knowing which safe house you re in it s not me i m worried for said harry we know that said mr weasley quietly but it would make our efforts tonight seem rather pointless if you left yer not goin anywhere growled hagrid blimey harry after all we wen through ter get you here yeah what about my bleeding ear said george hoisting himself up on his cushions i know that c mad eye wouldn t want c i know harry bellowed he felt beleaguered and blackmailed did they think he did not know what they had done for him didn t they understand that it was for precisely that reason that he wanted to go now before they had to suffer any more on his behalf there was a long and awkward silence in which his scar continued to prickle and throb and which was broken at last by mrs weasley where s hedwig harry she said coaxingly we can put her up with pidwidgeon and give her something to eat his insides clenched like a fist he could not tell her the truth he drank the last of his firewhisky to avoid answering wait till it gets out yeh did it again harry said hagrid escaped him fought him off when he was right on top of yeh it wasn t me said harry flatly it was my wand my wand acted of its own accord after a few moments hermione said gently but that s impossible harry you mean that you did magic without meaning to you reacted instinctively no said harry the bike was falling i couldn t have told you where voldemort was but my wand spun in my hand and found him and shot a spell at him and it wasn t even a spell i recognized i ve never made gold flames appear before often said mr weasley when you re in a pressured situation you can produce magic you never dreamed of small children often find before they re trained c it wasn t like that said harry through gritted teeth his scar was burning he felt angry and frustrated he hated the idea that they were all imagining him to have power to match voldemort s no one said anything he knew that they did not believe him now that he came to think of it he had never heard of a wand performing magic on its own before his scar seared with pain it was all he could do not to moan aloud muttering about fresh air he set down his glass and left the room as he crossed the yard the great skeletal thestral looked up c rustled its enormous batlike wings then resumed its grazing harry stopped at the gate into the garden staring out at its overgrown plants rubbing his pounding forehead and thinking of dumbledore dumbledore would have believed him he knew it dumbledore would have known how and why harry s wand had acted independently because dumbledore always had the answers he had known about wands had explained to harry the strange connection that existed between his wand and voldemort s but dumbledore like mad eye like sirius like his parents like his poor owl all were gone where harry could never talk to them again he felt a burning in his throat that had nothing to do with firewhisky and then out of nowhere the pain in his scar peaked as he clutched his forehead and closed his eyes a voice screamed inside his head you told me the problem would be solved by using another s wand and into his mind burst the vision of an emaciated old man lying in rags upon a stone floor screaming a horrible drawn out scream a scream of unendurable agony no no i beg you i beg you you lied to lord voldemort ollivander i did not i swear i did not you sought to help potter to help him escape me i swear i did not i believed a different wand would work explain then what happened lucius s wand is destroyed i cannot understand the connection exists only between your two wands lies please i beg you and harry saw the white hand raise its wand and felt voldemort s surge of vicious anger saw the frail old main on the floor writhe in agony c harry it was over as quickly as it had come harry stood shaking in the darkness clutching the gate into the garden his heart racing his scar still tingling it was several moments before he realized that ron and hermione were at his side harry come back in the house hermione whispered you aren t still thinking of leaving yeah you ve got to stay mate said ron thumping harry on the back are you all right hermione asked close enough now to look into harry s face you look awful well said harry shakily i probably look better than ollivander when he had finished telling them what he had seen ron looked appalled but hermione downright terrified but it was supposed to have stopped your scar c it wasn t supposed to do this anymore you mustn t let that connection open up again c dumbledore wanted you to close your mind when he did not reply she gripped his arm harry he s taking over the ministry and the newspapers and half the wizarding world don t let him inside your head too ");return 0;}
